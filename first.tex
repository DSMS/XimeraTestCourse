\maketitle

Since we've seen that the \emph{substitution rule} provides an integration rule/notation corresponding to the chain rule, it's natural to look for integral rules corresponding to other differentiation rules. In particular, integrals of \emph{products} are often hard to calculate.

\begin{problem}
Evaluate $\int xe^xdx$.

$\int xe^xdx = \answer{xe^x-e^x+C}$.
\begin{hint}
Try calculating $\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{x^2}{2}e^x)$.

It is a common mistake to try integrating each factor separately, we can see that this won't work!
\end{hint}
\begin{explanation}
This pitfall does point to some form of function to try as an antiderivative, since it appears that $xe^x$ could be the result of a chain rule differentiation if there is some ``cancelling'' term. Specifically $\frac{d}{dx}(xe^x-e^x)=e^x+xe^x-e^x=xe^x$. 

So \[\int xe^xdx=xe^x-e^x+C\]
\end{explanation}

\end{problem}
